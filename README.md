# BAW-BOP Modded Minecraft Server

Welcome to BAW-BOP-MC! This is a mod pack for our Minecraft Forge 1.20.1. Most of the mods in this pack are based off of [The Bunker Boys Modpack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/the-bunker-boys), although we've changed some things around to tailor it to our server experience.

Below, you will find the installation instructions for setting up the modpack manually. Alternatively, if you would like a more straightforward installation, you can use the Modrinth files, `.mrpack` or Curseforge files, `.zip`. Specific instructions will be included in Discord.

# "Which release do I choose?"

There are two versions of the modpack, either of which can be used to join the server. The only difference is the client-side visual quality:

**Client-Fast**: Contains the standard modpack (68 mods). Recommended for most players.
- **CPU:** Intel i5 (10th gen+) / AMD Ryzen 5 3600 or better
- **GPU:** GTX 1050 Ti / RX 570 or better
- **RAM:** 8GB system RAM. (Close out every other application before launching)
- **Storage:** SSD strongly recommended

**Client-Fancy**: Contains the full visual experience (70 mods + 4 shaderpacks). Exactly the same as Client-Fast, but with shader support and extended render distance (via Oculus and Farsight, respectively). Only use this if your PC is beefy enough to handle it comfortably.
- **CPU:** Intel i5 (12th gen+) / AMD Ryzen 5 5600X or better
- **GPU:** RTX 3060 / RX 6600 XT or better
- **RAM:** 16GB system RAM (32GB would be ideal)
- **Storage:** SSD required

If you're not sure which one to choose, **I recommend starting with Client-Fast**. You can always switch over to the Client-Fancy later on anyway. 
Additionally, check out the Performance Tips section below if you want to squeeze out any more performance from your system.

## Installing Manually

### Step 0: Run Minecraft 1.20.1 at least once

Before starting, we need to generate the game files that Minecraft Forge needs.

1. Open the Minecraft Launcher and go to **Installations** > **New Installation**
2. Select version **1.20.1** from the Installations tab and click **Install** at the bottom right. 
3. Launch the game. Wait until you reach the main menu, then close the game. 
 
<img src="repo-assets/select-version.png" alt="Screenshot of the installation menu with 1.20.1 selected" width="300">

### Step 1: Install Forge 47.4.10

**[Download Forge 1.20.1 - 47.4.10 Installer](https://maven.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.20.1-47.4.10/forge-1.20.1-47.4.10-installer.jar)**

Once downloaded:
1. Double-click the `.jar` file to run it. If it doesn't open, right-click > **Open With** > **Java(TM) Platform SE Binary**.
2. Make sure the path matches the same format as the image below. Select **"Install client"** and click **OK**.

<img src="repo-assets/forge-installer.png" alt="Screenshot of the forge installer with the file path and install client option selected" width="300">

3. Open the Minecraft Launcher and launch the profile labeled **1.20.1-forge-47.4.10**
4. Once it reaches the menu, confirm that the correct version is installed at the bottom left, then close the game.

### Step 2: Download the modpack

Go to the **[BAW-BOP-MC Releases](https://github.com/Maltent/BAW-BOP-MC/releases)** page and download the release determined in the section 'Which release do I choose?':
- `BAW-BOP-client-fast-vX.X.zip`
- `BAW-BOP-client-fancy-vX.X.zip`

### Step 3: Clean your mods folder

Before installing, make sure your `.minecraft` folder doesn't have leftover mods from a previous modded playthrough. If there are existing files in your `mods/` or `shaderpacks/` folders or `options.txt`, copy them somewhere safe on your computer (e.g. in a folder on your Desktop), then delete everything in your `mods/` folder.

 An empty mods folder is important, as any stray mods from other packs will cause crashes/incompatibility with joining the server.

To find your `.minecraft` folder:
1. Press **Windows + R** on your keyboard
2. Type `%appdata%` and click **OK**
3. Open the `.minecraft` folder (first folder in the list)

<img src="repo-assets/windows-run.png" alt="Screenshot of the Windows Run menu with %appdata% in the text box" width="300">

If you don't see a `mods/` folder, that's fine, as we will be creating it in the next step.

### Step 4: Extract the modpack

1. Open the zip file you downloaded. Inside, you'll see a `mods/` folder. (If you downloaded Fancy, you'll see a `shaderpacks/` folder too)

2. Extract the contents of the zip directly into your `.minecraft` folder. 
    * This can be done by drag-and-dropping or copying the files from the zip folder **directly** into `.minecraft`. 
    * The contents of the zip should merge with your existing files, and your `mods/` folder should now contain several `.jar` files.

  <img src="repo-assets/mods-folder.png" alt="Screenshot of the mods folder, showing all the .jar files inside after unzipping" width="49%" />
</p>

### Step 5: Configure RAM Allocation

Modpacks require much more RAM than typical minecraft, so the default value will cause several lag spikes.

1. Open the Minecraft Launcher
2. Go to **Installations** > click your Forge profile > the three dots > **Edit**
3. Expand **More Options** at the bottom right
4. In the **JVM Arguments** box, find `-Xmx2G` (or similar) and change it to:
   - 4GB (MINIMUM): `-Xmx4G`
   - 6GB (RECOMMENDED): `-Xmx6G`
   - 8GB (16GB+ RAM): `-Xmx8G`
5. Make sure to click **Save** before closing.

Additionally, you can also consider adding the following flags to the JVM Arguments. These may help with memory garbage collection:

``-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=16M``

<img src="repo-assets/jvm-flags.png" alt="Screenshot of the edit installation menu in the minecraft launcher, showing jvm arguments at the bottom" width="275">

## Installing with Curseforge

### Step 0: Download and install the CurseForge app

1. Visit [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app) and download the CurseForge app for your operating system.
2. Find the installer in your Downloads folder and run it.
3. Click **Next**, then accept the Privacy Policy by clicking the **check box** on the left, then click **Next** again. It should start promptly installing
4. If it asks you to install any other software (e.g. Outplayed), make sure to click **No Thanks**--they aren't necessary to have.

### Step 1: Download from Github

Go to the **[BAW-BOP-MC Releases](https://github.com/Maltent/BAW-BOP-MC/releases)** page and download one of the two `.zip` files determined in the section 'Which release do I choose?':
- `BAW-BOP-curseforge-fast-vX.X.zip`
- `BAW-BOP-curseforge-fancy-vX.X.zip`

### Step 2: Import the modpack

In the CurseForge app:
1. Starting at the **Home** screen (top left house icon), click on **Minecraft**.
2. Select the **Import** button.
3. Select **Choose .zip file** and import the `.zip` you just downloaded.
4. Curseforge will then download Forge 1.20.1-47.4.10 and all the mods automatically. Give it a few minutes to finish downloading everything.

<img src="repo-assets/curseforge-import.png" alt="Screenshot of where the import button is in Curseforge" width="500">

### Step 3: Configure RAM allocation
This step is really important for making sure that the pack runs smoothly. The settings will depend on how much RAM your PC has. 

Starting from the **My Modpacks** menu:

1. Select the **BAW-BOP-MC** pack
2. Click on the **three vertical dots** next to "Play" > Select **Profile Options**
3. Scroll down to the **Advanced Settings** section and into the **Additional Arguments** box.
4. Depending on your system, find `-Xmx2G` and change it to:
   - 4GB (MINIMUM): `-Xmx4G`
   - 6GB (RECOMMENDED): `-Xmx6G`
   - 8GB (16GB+ RAM): `-Xmx8G`
5. Make sure to click **Done** after making changes.

## Installing with Modrinth

### Step 0: Download the Modrinth app

For a much easier installation process, you can use the Modrinth app. The installation location is also seperated under `%appdata%/roaming/modrinthapp/profiles` rather than the traditional `%appdata%/roaming/.minecraft`

1. Download the [Modrinth app](https://modrinth.com/app)
2. When first running Modrinth, sign in using your Minecraft/Microsoft account.

<img src="repo-assets/modrinth-signin.png" alt="Screenshot of Modrinth Sign-in" width="300">

### Step 1: Download the .mrpack file

Go to the **[BAW-BOP-MC Releases](https://github.com/Maltent/BAW-BOP-MC/releases)** page and download one of the two `.mrpack` files determined in the section 'Which release do I choose?':
- `BAW-BOP-modrinth-fast-vX.X.mrpack`
- `BAW-BOP-modrinth-fancy-vX.X.mrpack`

### Step 2: Import the modpack to Modrinth

1. Find the + on the left sign of the Modrinth app.
2. Select the **Install Modpack** option and then **Import Modpack**.
3. Select the `.mrpack` file that you downloaded.

A warning will appear since the file is not officially uploaded to Modrinth. Ensure you only recieved the file from the **official** github release. If so, you can safely select **Install Anyways**.

<img src="repo-assets/modrinth-warning.png" alt="Screenshot of Modrinth modpack import warning" width="350">

### Step 3: Configure RAM allocation

Modpacks require much more RAM than typical minecraft, so the default value will cause several lag spikes.

1. Open your Modrinth Library on the left side, right-click the modpack instance, and select **View instance**
2. In the top-right, click on gear icon and and navigate to **Java and memory**
3. Under Memory allocated, select custom allocation and input one of the values below:
   - 4096 MB (MINIMUM)
   - 6144 MB (RECOMMENDED)
   - 8192 MB (16GB+ RAM)

Additionally, you can also consider adding the following under custom Java Arguments. These may help with memory garbage collection:

``-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20 -XX:G1ReservePercent=20 -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=50 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=16M``

<img src="repo-assets/modrinth-ram.png" alt="Screenshot of custom RAM allocation screen" width="500">

## Final Step: Adding keybinds

As a final step to any installation that you choose, you need to alter the keybinds for many mods to be usable.

1. Download `options.txt` in the respective release page.
2. Place this file directly in the `.minecraft` or respective folder, right outside of the mods and shaderpack folder.

Only download this once as it resets your graphics settings to defaults.

You can now launch and play through whichever installation method you chose!

# Server Admin Information


## Repo Structure

This repo is organized into layers that combine to create the different releases:

 - `base/` contains all the mods shared across the server and all clients
 - `client/` has all mods necessary for every client release
 - `visuals/` holds graphics mods and shaders for the Client-Fancy release
 - `server/` includes only server-side mods
 - `releases/` contains powershell scripts that are used on a local repo to quickly package the Github releases.

**Structure of each release:**
 - `Client-Fancy`
    * `base/` + `client/` + `visuals/`
 - `Client-Fast`
    * `base/` + `client/`

Mods in the `server/` folder are not packaged into any releases.


## Building Releases (For Admins)

Run the following commands sequentially in Powershell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Maltent/BAW-BOP-MC
cd C:\Users\<USERNAME>\BAW-BOP-MC\releases
build-client-fast.ps1
build-client-fancy.ps1
```

This creates zip files in the `releases/` folder with a `VX.X` placeholder version. Make sure to rename them to the actual version number before uploading to GitHub.

Currently only functional for manual installation zip files.
